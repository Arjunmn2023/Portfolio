# Power BI virtual case experience in PwC Switzerland Data Analytics
We want to create unique technology solutions that will set us apart from the competition and help us digitize the business. Part of that was a strategic choice to invest in upskilling programs to teach our employees how to use digital tools for data visualization, automation, data cleansing, and other tasks.

If our employees could use these technologies to tackle common challenges, we would be more efficient and growth-oriented now, as well as more innovative in Business Services and beyond. Employees are now learning how to create bots (over 2,400 have been created thus far) to automate workflows. We continue to invest in machine learning, PowerBI, and, eventually, artificial intelligence (AI) to make processes more intuitive. We and our customers.

This is why you've arrived! Our Digital Accelerator program is an internal opportunity that takes groups of our employees away from their regular employment and places them in training that teaches them technology skills such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is a crucial component since visualizing data aids in dealing with and understanding clients.
