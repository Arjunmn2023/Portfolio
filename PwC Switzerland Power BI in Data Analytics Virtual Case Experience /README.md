# Power BI virtual case experience in PwC Switzerland Data Analytics
We want to create unique technology solutions that will set us apart from the competition and help us digitize the business. Part of that was a strategic choice to invest in upskilling programs to teach our employees how to use digital tools for data visualization, automation, data cleansing, and other tasks.

If our employees could use these technologies to tackle common challenges, we would be more efficient and growth-oriented now, as well as more innovative in Business Services and beyond. Employees are now learning how to create bots (over 2,400 have been created thus far) to automate workflows. We continue to invest in machine learning, PowerBI, and, eventually, artificial intelligence (AI) to make processes more intuitive. We and our customers.

This is why you've arrived! Our Digital Accelerator program is an internal opportunity that takes groups of our employees away from their regular employment and places them in training that teaches them technology skills such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is a crucial component since visualizing data aids in dealing with and understanding clients.

Possible KPIs include (to help you get started, but are not limited to):

## Task 1: Call Centre Trends
Create a Power BI dashboard for Claire that includes the necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the dataset. Be inventive!

**Examples of possible KPIs include (but are not limited to)::**
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs. calls answered

## Task 2: Customer Retention
Within a few weeks after we deliver your dashboard to management, the telecom's Engagement Manager contacts you personally. He was thrilled with your work and asked if you might create a dashboard for client retention.

In addition, to better comprehend the data, the Telco Retention Manager has set a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to discuss the following topics:
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don't want to lose them.
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of contract termination.
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don't want to lose them.
 - Currently, we contact them after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactive: it would be better to know who is at risk in advance.
 - We've done customer analysis with Excel, but it's always resulted in a dead end.
-We'd want to learn more about our customers: properly visualized so that our management can understand it. Look through the resource area for information offered by the retention manager.

![Task 2_3](https://github.com/Arjunmn2023/Portfolio/assets/142002638/abb4b30d-daa5-4078-9ca9-602fb5a223cf)


## Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion
Our telecom client's human resources department values diversity and inclusion. They've been working hard to increase gender balance in upper management, but they haven't seen any results. They're asking for our assistance.

PwC Switzerland is frequently approached by customers seeking assistance with diversity and inclusion. To compete in an increasingly complicated and heterogeneous environment, businesses require a staff with various abilities and backgrounds. Diversity and inclusion, to us, are business imperatives, not nice-to-haves. We want everyone of our teams to feel welcome and valued. However, obtaining this and realizing its full potential entails a slew of practical problems.

Here's an idea: Calculating the following metrics might aid in the development of appropriate KPIs:
- number of men
- number of women
- number of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover 
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women
